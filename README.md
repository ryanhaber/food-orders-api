# Food Orders API

I found this: [Creating Web APIs with Python and Flask ](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask#creating-a-basic-flask-application) and am using it to build out a little REST service. The purpose, for now, is for s.a.g.

# To Use:

1. Have python and flask installed. pymongo is necessary if you want to use the templates pages that I have commented out.
2. Clone the repo
3. Run the py script
4. To get the simple API's simple docs, call run 127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser or GET 127.0.0.1:5000 from your favorite client
