# Food Orders API

I found this: [Creating Web APIs with Python and Flask ](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask#creating-a-basic-flask-application) and am using it to build out a little REST service. The purpose, for now, is for s.a.g.

# To Use:

1. Have python and flask installed. pymongo is necessary if you want to use the templates pages that I have commented out.
2. Clone the repo
3. Run the py script
4. To get the simple API's simple docs, call run 127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser or GET 127.0.0.1:5000 from your favorite client



`NOTE:`

This is a gross and horrible little API **that works** (at least on my machine ðŸ¤£). You can run on your machine pretty easily.

`You're not allowed to judge me because I'm not an engineer and I never claimed to be one.` ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜„

I'm just hacking around to up my game. I'm gonna keep hacking away to make this better, clean up some of the horror, and maybe eventually host on Heroku, but for now, "Look, Mom! No hands!"
